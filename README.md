# nbc

A very very simple and easy to use number base converter written in go.

## Install

```bash
go get github.com/nanyan/nbc
```

## Usage

It's just convert an input num string to another base num string as the output.

```bash
~ Â» nbc -h
nbc -- A very very simple and easy to use number base converter.

Usage: nbc [options] numString

Options:
  -h      show the usage.
  -i int  input base, must be 0 or a value between 2 and 62. default is determined by input number.
  -o int  output base, must be 0 or a value between 2 and 62. default is determined by input base.

Description:
  The base argument must be 0 or a value between 2 and 62. If the base is 0, the string prefix determines the actual conversion base. A prefix of "0x" or "0X" selects base 16; the "0" prefix selects base 8, and a "0b" or "0B" prefix selects base 2. Otherwise the selected base is 10.
If the output base is not set(or set to 0), then the actual output base will be determined by the input base, when -i is 10, then default output base is 16; otherwise output base is default 10.
For bases <= 36, lower and upper case letters are considered the same: The letters 'a' to 'z' and 'A' to 'Z' represent digit values 10 to 35. For bases > 36, the upper case letters 'A' to 'Z' represent the digit values 36 to 61.

The input number also support scientific notation base 10, such as 1e18 or 1^18.

Example:
  nbc 0xff    //convert hex number 0xff to decimal
  nbc 10^18   //convert a big decimal to hexadecimal
  nbc 1e18    //also convert a big decimal to hexadecimal
  nbc -o 2 16 //convert decimal 16 to binary string
```
